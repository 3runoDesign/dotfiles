# Dotfiles

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

A handful of code helpers and settings for my workflow.

## Setup

1. Update macOS to the latest version through the App Store
1. Install [Laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop)
1. Run the installer script `./install.sh`
